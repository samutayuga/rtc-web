# WebRTC for Screen Recording
## What
I would like to have a way to record the webpage and send the recording  file into a server, so that the server can
make it available for further use, such as replay or live-streaming.

## How
Use the existing framework, 
thanks to [Record RTC](https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/RecordRTC)
on top of `getUserMedia()` API.
